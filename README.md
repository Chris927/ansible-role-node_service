# What is This?

It's a [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com)
[role](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_roles.html) to provision a
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) service.

Be Warned: This role is not sufficiently generic to be used in any environment,
it is e.g. tested on Ubuntu 14.04 only. It's made available here purely in the
hope somebody may find it useful.
